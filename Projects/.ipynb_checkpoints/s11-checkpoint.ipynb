    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively dense (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively sparse (represented as a bag-of-words). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Why doesn't nearest neighbors work well for this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "kNN models are based on metrics of proximity/similartiy, based on features of the items (which acts as coordinates or dimensions). In topic classification the challenge is that the number of features that define the space (be them words or character n-grams) are almost infinite, but we train our model with a very limited number of features: the ones that are present in the examples from the training set. Thus, we are omitting many other dimensions, (in other classification problems we limit our knowledge to a hyperplane in the feature space—like a square in a plane—; here we are limited to a plane in a cube, so to speak).**\n",
    "\n",
    "But I think that the main problem is that we are assigning the same weight to all the features in the training set. There will be lots of common words shared by all the training examples, as well as the example that we want to predict, that will lead to similar distances between that example that we want to predict and any pair of training examples, regardless of their topics, that will cause many predictions to be inaccurate. The solution would be to give more weight to topic-related words, and less to common words (shared by examples from every topic).**\n",
    "\n",
    "To continue with a simplified example, think of a 3-D space where *x=graphics*, *y=religion*, *z=common words*: if a graphics' training example has coordinates $(2,0,18)$, and a religion's training example has coordinates $(0,2,20)$, a dev example related to graphics, with coordinates $(1,0,20)$ would be equally close ($\\sqrt 5$) to the training examples.**\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Any ideas why logistic regression doesn't work as well as Naive Bayes?\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, NB (a generative model) has greater bias but lower variance than Logistic Regression (a discriminative model). Both lower bias and higher variance are needed to get better predictions: bias (which is related to underfitting) is what causes error rate in both the training set and the dev set to be high (and roughly equal); variance (which is related to overfitting) is what causes the error rate in the dev set to increase while the error rate in the training set keeps decreasing, and hence it's a problem when the model is too complex, given a fixed dataset size.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias appears in NB models when NB assumptions are not met (mainly, the conditional independence assumption, that states that the features are independent of each other given the class; e.g., given that a document is about *space*, \"*launch*\" and \"*spacecraft*\" are independent of each other). (Some sources mention that, provided the NB assumptions hold, NB and Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes perform almost identically as the number of training examples approaches infinity.)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that Logistic Regression doesn't work as well as NB suggests that the bias of the latter is not as large as the higher variance of Logistic Regression. I.e., it seems that the conditional independence assumption holds, even though that doesn't seem correct in text classification (words are highly dependent of each other). The truth is that the assumption is broken, but that's not a big deal—of course, the probability estimates will be inaccurate, but it's how they compare to each other what we care about (i.e., which class gets the highest score), so the decisions will be good.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To put an example, let's remember that:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**$$P(\\text{class} \\mid \\text{features}) = \\frac{P(\\text{features} \\mid \\text{class}) \\cdot P(\\text{class})}{\\sum_{\\forall \\text{class}} P(\\text{features} \\mid \\text{class}) \\cdot P(class)}$$**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the dev example we want to classify has a set of features $f$: most of the features are typical in *atheism* but not in the other topics. To simplify the example, let's assume the only other topic is *graphics*. That means that $P(f \\mid \\text{atheism})$ will be much greater than $P(f \\mid \\text{graphics})$, causing $P(\\text{atheism} \\mid f)$ to be much greater than $P(\\text{graphics} \\mid f)$. These two probability estimates will be inaccurate (in many cases, the former will be close to 1 and the latter close to 0), but what matters—when it makes to classifying—is not what their values are, but simply that $P(\\text{atheism} \\mid f) > P(\\text{graphics} \\mid f)$.**\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, variance is a problem in Logistic Regression because the model is *too complex*. We can approximate the complexity as the ratio of features and training examples: we have so many features, compared to the number of training examples, that variance becomes a problem and makes Logistic Regression perform worse than NB. If we had more training examples (although that might involve more features too, in text classification), Logistic Regression would perform better than Naive Bayes (that works better with less training data, as the estimates are based on joint probabilities).**\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Briefly explain the relationship between the sum and the value of C.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the plot above, it looks like the relationship between the sum—its average value for the 4 classes has been plotted, but the graph would not look very different for each particular class—and the value of C can be approximated as $k \\cdot C^{\\alpha}$, where $k$ and $\\alpha$ are constants, with $\\alpha < 1$.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is coherent with the fact that *smaller values (of C) specify stronger regularization*, so as C approaches zero, all the coefficients (for any class) also approach zero, resulting in:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**$$P(Y \\mid \\theta) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-\\theta}} \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{1+e^0} = \\frac{1}{2}$$**\n",
    "\n",
    "I.e., as expected a very strong regularization leads to the null model, in which we are uncertain about the category and assign a 50% likelihood to any of them (the classification may be seem as random). On the other hand, as we penalize less and less (the complexity of the model), the sum of the squared weight values increases, and so do the relevance of the features. But it is important to note that it's the *absolute* values (because we are squaring them) which increase: the features that are common in a topic will have positive values, leading to an increase in the likelihood of belonging to that topic if the example we want to classify have those features; on the other hand, features that are not so common in a given topic may be great in absolute value, but will be negative, thus decreasing an example's likelihood of belonging to that topic if that example have those features.**\n"

    "**When we use words, the model makes a relatively good work finding the ones that are most frequent in a topic and less in the others. Hence, we see that the weight values for those *top 5* features have a relatively large positive value for the corresponding class (e.g., 0.66 for \"*computer*\" associated with *graphics*), and a large absolute value, but negative, for the other classes (e.g., see the weights of \"*computer*\" for the other 3 classes; it's only close to 0 for *atheism*; also note that the same happens with the word \"*religion*:\" 0.59 for *atheism*, -0.26 for both *graphics* and *space*, and close to 0 for *religion*). I.e., the presence of those features increase significantly the likelihood of being part of that class, and also the likelihood of not being part of the others.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**When we use bigrams, it is unrare that two words associated with one topic—and not the others—appear together (e.g., \"*nasa orbit*\" or \"*computer 3d*\"). Exceptions are \"*the moon*\" or \"*the space*,\" and do note that their weight values are large for *space* and large in absolute value but negative for the other 3 classes. In general, typical bigrams are like the ones that are shown in the 2nd table: \"*in this*,\" \"*out there*,\" or \"*and such*.\" They are not exclusive of a certain topic, and hence it's not so unlikely to find some in training examples of other topics: that causes that the weight values, when positive, are not so great (most of them are between 0.3 and 0.5 instead of between 0.5 and 0.8, as it occurred in the 1st table), and when they are negative (i.e., the weight values for a bigram when inspecting the likelihood of a different class), they are also not great in absolute value. Exceptions are \"*the moon*\" or \"*the space*,\" as mentioned, but look for example at \"*the fbi*\" or \"*the word*.\"**"

    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

Evaluate and show the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",

    "ANSWER: \n",
    "\n",
    "How is TfidfVectorizer different from CountVectorizer?\n",
    "\n",
    "**TfidfVectorizer is different from CountVectorizer because it gives less weight (i.e., importance) to words that are common to most documents (such as articles or common verbs), hence carrying very little meaningful information about the actual topic of a document, and that may *shadow* the frequencies of rarer yet more interesting terms. Each item of the sparse matrix is transformed to floating point values, whose value decreases if the original values are non-zero for most rows, and each row is normalized to have unit euclidean norm.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall the accuracy that we achieve is higher than the one we get using CountVectorizer. But very short texts (like the last 2 examples printed above) are likely to have noisy tf–idf values.**\n",
    "\n",
    "What kinds of mistakes is the model making? Suggest a way to address one particular issue that you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The histograms shown above show some general trends. As mentioned in the last comments to the code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* We can see that classifying an *Atheism* example as another topic happens much more frequently than the opposite (classifying another topic as *Atheism*). The same happens with *Space*.**\n",
    "* On the other hand, there are fewer examples of *Graphics* classified as another topic than examples of other topics classified as *Graphics*.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***Atheism* is the most frequently misclassified category, mainly as *Religion*, and with R ratios up to 300.**\n",
    "* ***Graphics* is the least frequently misclassified category (mainly as *Space*). This is coherent with what we had previously observed in the previous graphs.**\n",
    "* ***Space* is also not frequently misclassified (as *Graphics*, in most cases).**\n",
    "* ***Religion* is very frequently misclassified, mainly as *Atheism*, and with R ratios up to 1000.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Top 3 examples give us clues about what causes the errors. The 2 main problems (which appear even if we grow the list to show the Top 5 or Top 10) are:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Other categories are missclassified as *graphics* when they contain computer-related terms, such as \"*ftp*,\" \"*internet*,\", \"*online*,\" or \"*ftp*,\" that are very common in that context.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***Religion* and *atheism* have many terms in common, so they're easily confused and missclassified.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**A possible solution to the first problem would be to exclude from our dictionary those computer-related words than are frequently found in *graphics*, but are not exclusive of it whatsoever.**"
