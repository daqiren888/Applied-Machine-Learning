    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively dense (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively sparse (represented as a bag-of-words). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

    "ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q4:  Why doesn't k-Nearest Neighbors work well for this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Firstly, it is important for KNN models to measure the weight of neighbors, so that the weight of the closer neighbor is greater than the weight of the far neighbor. However,  in this problem we assigned the same weight to all the features in the training set. In this work, all training samples and testing samples share many unweighted common words that cause the distance between any pair of samples to be similar, without taking the case of their topics, which will cause many predictions to be inaccurate . The solution is to give more weight to the words related to the topic, rather than to the frequency of the common words.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Secondly, the kNN model is based on a measure of proximity/similarity, based on the characteristics of the items (acting as coordinates or dimensions). In K-NN learning, local approximation and all calculations are postponed until classification.  The neighbors are all taken from a set of objects that have been correctly classified.  The disadvantage of the k-nearest neighbor algorithm is that it is very sensitive to the local structure of the data. In topic classification, the challenge is that the number of features defining the space is almost unlimited, but we train our model with a very limited number of features: the features present in the example are taken from the training set. Therefore, we have omitted many other dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "#### Q5: Why doesn't Logistic Regression work as well as Naive Bayes does?\n",
    " \n",
    "(1) When the data set is relatively small, Naive Bayes performs better and should be used. It can achieve good results with less data demand. When the data set is relatively large, Logistic Regression should be selected. Naive Bayes uses a relatively strict conditional independence assumption. In order to calculate P(y|x), we can use statistical methods to count the number of occurrences of P(x|y) and P(y) in the data set, thereby obtaining P(x |y) and P(y). Therefore, the amount of data required is smaller. When Logistic Regression is calculated, a linear search is performed in the entire parameter space, and the data set required is larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Naive Bayes (NB) and logistic regression models obtain  their weights in two different ways. The reason for the difference lies in the conditional independence assumption of the naive Bayes method. Because of the conditional independence assumption, Naive Bayes can not use gradient descent, but directly count the logical occurrence ratio of each feature as a weight. In logistic regression, the conditional independence assumption does not hold. Through the gradient descent method, the coupling information between the features can be obtained, and the corresponding weights can be obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q6: What is the relationship between logistic regression's sum of squared weights vs. C value?\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) As shown in the plot above, C is the inverse of regularization strength. Smaller values of C ( bigger value of regularization ) results in stronger regularization (stronger penalty) and hence decreases weights. The same, as C goes bigger ( smaller value of regularization)  the sum of the weights becomes bigger. If the penalty is too strong, the model will underestimate the weights and underfit the problem. If the penalty is too weak, the model will be allowed to overfit the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) In this problem the L2 regularization has been used. The increase of C value will increase the sum of the squares of all weight w parameters. The decrease of C ( i.e. increase of regularization or penalty) will  force all w to be as close as possible to zero but not zero (the derivative of L2 tends to zero). \n",

Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

    "####  Explain what the R ratio describes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) The number of R>1 cases means the number of errors existing in the prediction results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "(2) When R>1, the value of R means how serious the error is. The bigger the R value is, the worse the error happens. \n",
    "\n",
    "(3) We need to look into both the R>1 case numbers and the R values to find out the reason for the errors,  and find the solution to resolve it. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### What kinds of mistakes is the model making?\n",
    "\n",
    "CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer are two common methods of feature engineering and numerical calculation. For each training text, CountVectorizer only considers the frequency of each vocabulary in the training text. TfidfVectorizer is different from CountVectorizer: in addition to considering the frequency of a vocabulary in the current training text, TfidfVectorizer also pays attention to the number of other training texts that contain this vocabulary. In contrast, the more the number of training texts, the more advantageous the feature quantization method of TfidfVectorizer.because it assigns less weight (or importance) to common words in most documents (such as articles or common verbs), so it carries very little meaningful information about the actual topic of the document, and may affect The frequency of rarer but more interesting terms. In general, the accuracy obtained from  TfidfVectorizer is higher than the accuracy we obtained with CountVectorizer. But very short text (like the last 2 examples printed above) may have noisy tf-idf values, and this may result in mistakes. I have plotted the histogram F1-16 shows the general trends: F1, F2, F3, F4  shows the total mistakes made in the model. The rest of figures show the misprediction to each different topic. from our observation in figures:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) The frequency of classifying an example of atheism as another topic is much more frequent than the opposite (classifying another topic as atheism). The same is true of space.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) There are fewer examples of graphics categorized as other topics than examples of other topics categorized as graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Atheism is the most misclassified category, mainly religion, with an R ratio as high as 300.This is because religion and atheism have many things in common, so it is easy to confuse and misclassify.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Like (3),  Religions are often misclassified, mainly atheism, and the R ratio is as high as 1,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Graphs are the least frequently misclassified category (mainly space). This is consistent with what we have observed in the previous chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "(6) Spaces are not often misclassified (graphics in most cases).\n",

    " \n",
    "#### Suggest a way to address one particular issue that you see.\n",

    "Topic 'Religion' and 'atheism' are mostly confused with each other, my solution would be to exclude from the dictionary those common words of both dataset in the training model. In detail,\n",

    "#### Approach: \n",
    "\n",
    "Topic 'Religion' and 'atheism' are mostly confused with each other, my solution would be to exclude from the dictionary those common words of both dataset in the training model. In detail,\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) find top 300 most common used words from each topic, do inner joint, result a set of words that are mostly common used by all topics;\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) find top 300 most common used words from topic 'religion' and 'atheism, do inner joint, result a set of words that are mostly common by these 2 topics;\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) minus (1) from (2);\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) pickup words manually, then exclouds these words from the training model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Result: after optimization, the accuracy for a Logistic Regression classifier using TfidfVectorizer is 78.55%, that is increased 2.22% comparing with original 76.33%;  Percentage of incorrectly predicted labels (R>1) is 21.45%, that is decreased 2.22% comparing with original 23.67%.\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) I proposed an automatic solution to search what stop_words should be excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2)  I excluded stop_words from class Region and atheism,  as well as stop words that are common in multiple classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) The parameters of the logistic regression model are modified ( e.g. C= 300  etc) to serve the training better.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) I know there are many other options, such as lowercasing the text, however I only want to focus on the vocabulary confusion among 2 classes, hope to see if the problem can be solved using my approach and if the performance can be improved.   "
