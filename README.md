# Applied-Machine-Learning

The main contents in this repo are the homeworks that I have done in US Berkeley W207 course 'Applied machine Learning'. This course provides a broad introduction to the key ideas in machine learning. The emphasis will be on intuition and practical examples rather 
than theoretical results, though some experience with probability, statistics, and linear algebra will be important.

It covers the field at the intersection of computer science and statistics concerned with finding patterns in data, also tremendous advances in technology, 
from personalized product recommendations to speech recognition in cell phones. [1]
